Tools with a strong cloud affinity like Jib and GitHub Actions simplifiy the development process much smoother, helping you easily manage containerization and automate deployments. Keycloak also stands out with its great portability and compatibility, ensuring fluent integration of authentication services into applications regardless of the infrastructure used.

> This project involves a **React UI**, a **Spring-based Backend for Frontend (BFF)**, and **Keycloak** as an identity broker integrated with **GitHub** as the identity provider (IdP). The goal is to log in via GitHub through Keycloak and display simple text data from a **remote service** on the React UI. The focus is on implementing OAuth2 authentication using Keycloak and understanding identity brokering.

## 0. Backend for Frontend: a Spring Cloud Gateway project   

The Backend for Frontend (BFF) pattern serves as an essential edge service that interacts with Single Page Applications (SPAs) while handling security concerns. As a gateway, the BFF acts as an intermediary between the SPA and various backend services. It efficiently routes requests from the SPA to the appropriate services.

When it comes to security management, the BFF plays a central role in authentication. It can integrate with identity providers, such as Keycloak, to manage user sessions and validate tokens. 

Spring Cloud Gateway is an ideal choice for implementing a BFF in this scenario, since it provides a lightweight, scalable, and highly customizable API gateway solution, perfectly suited to act as the edge service for SPAs. Along with Spring Security dependency, the gateway service provides a well-managing interface between a user and the whole features of our project.
